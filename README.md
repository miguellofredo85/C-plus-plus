C++ from the absolute beginning all the way to very advanced topics, the topics you need in areas where C++ is used massively in modern times.

This course was carefully designed in a way  that it  will make you ready to take on technologies  and industries where C++ is widely used, by teaching you Modern C++ the way it is used in industry, and you will learn and master how to use shiny new features from the latest C++ standard (C++20) like ranges, modules coroutines, concepts, the three way comparison infrastructure and many more features spread out through out chapters and lectures in the course.

This course will teach you modern C++ from the absolute beginning all the way to a point where you can use advanced features like function templates, class templates, polymorphism, move semantics, functors , callbacks, STL container, iterators and algorithms, I will even show you how to build iterators for your own collection types, giving you the tools to  plug into the infrastructure provided by the C++ standard library to tune it to your own needs. Here are some of the things you'll get to master through this course :
